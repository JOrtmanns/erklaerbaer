    <p>Ever explained something to a famaly member. Maybe a grandparent, or parent. Then you know that after your explanaiton you had to explain the same thing over and over again.</p>
    <p>If they could use google or similar tools to search for the explanations they wouldn't need your help in the first place.</p>
    <p>With Erklärbär you create your own instructions with images, videos and text. They can be searched by talking to the app.</p>
    <h3>Be the face of your families and friends instructions.</h3>
